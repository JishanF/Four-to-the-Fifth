Proposal
-----------------
We propose a simple objective based video game. The game should have a well defined objective with at least 3 distinct levels. An enemy unit (or units) should be defined to give the game a level of difficulty. The main character in the game should have a unique weapon to give the player a sense of power and a tool with which to achieve the game objective. Along with this should be a leveling system so that the player grows stronger over the course of the game. At the end of the game there should be a final boss fight.
